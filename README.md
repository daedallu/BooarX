# BOOARX

## What is this?

BooarX is just a password-list generator, in a germinal stage, for educational purposes (Python && C studies).

Its just an silly and rough project, yet.

BooarX is an term app that generates in an interactive way, a list of passwords based on inserted data about the "target".

Yes, I've inspired by Cupp project! (of course, BooarX is very rough yet )

Comming soon, a version written in C, maybe.
